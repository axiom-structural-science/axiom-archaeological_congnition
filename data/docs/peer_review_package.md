2. **Data Validation Protocol** (`data_validation_protocol.md`)  
3. **Complete Dataset** (`raw/archaeological_findings.csv`)
4. **Concept Evolution Timeline** (`raw/concept_evolution.json`)

### Analysis Tools:

## Review Criteria

### Theoretical Framework Assessment:
- [ ] AXIOM node definitions clear and consistent
- [ ] Cognitive concept mappings logically sound
- [ ] Evolutionary sequence biologically plausible
- [ ] Cross-cultural patterns statistically significant

### Methodological Rigor:
- [ ] Archaeological data collection protocols adequate
- [ ] Dating methods appropriately applied
- [ ] Interpretation criteria consistently applied
- [ ] Confidence scoring system transparent

### Empirical Validation:
- [ ] Site sample sufficiently large and diverse
- [ ] Geographic coverage adequate for claims
- [ ] Temporal distribution supports evolutionary sequence
- [ ] Alternative explanations adequately considered

## Expected Review Questions

### Likely Methodological Questions:
1. "How were ambiguous artifact interpretations resolved?"
2. "What criteria determined concept-to-artifact mappings?"
3. "How were dating uncertainties incorporated into analysis?"
4. "What measures prevented confirmation bias?"

### Theoretical Questions:
5. "Why these 18 specific concepts versus alternatives?"
6. "How does this framework compare to existing cognitive models?"
7. "What predictions does this make for future discoveries?"
8. "How scalable is this to other domains?"

### Empirical Questions:
9. "How robust are the patterns to removal of borderline cases?"
10. "What is the statistical significance of the evolutionary sequence?"
11. "How does this align with genetic and linguistic evidence?"
12. "What are the most compelling individual case studies?"

## Response Preparation

### Data Availability Statement:
All data and analysis tools are available in the GitHub repository:
`github.com/axiom-structural-science/axiom-archaeological_cognition`

### Replication Instructions:
1. Download complete dataset from `raw/` directory
2. Run analysis tools in `analysis/` directory  
3. Review methodology in `docs/` directory
4. Validate mappings against source publications

### Limitations Disclosure:
- Tropical region underrepresentation
- Interpretation subjectivity in early symbols
- Dating uncertainties in oldest sites
- Research intensity variations by region
